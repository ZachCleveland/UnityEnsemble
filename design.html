<h2>Our Architecture</h2>

<img src="/UnityEnsemble/unknown.png" alt="Domain Model" width="400" height="320">

<p>User uses the Keyboard input to control the main character sprite, who will then interact with different objects; these objects could be pushable/pullable boxes, clickable slot machines, or bottles. Note: the sheet music section in the architecture is now obsolete.</p>


<h2>Major classes</h2>
<p>Player</p>
<p> - Be able to move in all directions (playerMovement script)</p>
<p> - Be able to interact with objects (clicking and pressing keys)</p>
<p> - Is it a singleton class? Yes.</p>
<p>Interactable objects:</p>
<p> - Bottles - playable, each bottle will play a unique pitch</p>
<p> - Slot machines - clickable, use RNG to determine if win or loss</p>
<p> - Trap doors - allow player to move between rooms, these are the triggers for scene transitions</p>
<p> - Boxes - can be pushed or pulled by the player. Putting boxes in the correct location triggers pressure plates.</p>
<p> - Pressure plates - unlocks the next level</p>
<p> - Is it a singleton class? No.</p>
<p>Maps</p>
<p> - Boundaries - prevents the player from leaving the map</p>
<p> - Camera - follows the character as it moves along the map</p>
<p> - Is it a singleton class? No.</p>

<h2>Control issues:</h2>
<p>Minor Issue: Level loading imports the Regular Expressions class from Microsoftâ€™s .NET framework. Would need to have the framework installed alongside the game for new users.</p>
